# 📦 Glue3D 
### *The Definitive 3D Game Engine for Vanilla Scratch*

Ever wanted to make a 3D game on Scratch, but found the technical details overwhelming? Or perhaps 3D collisions and physics felt out of reach?

**Glue3D** is designed with the creator in mind. It allows you to bypass the long, time-consuming process of coding a 3D engine from scratch, giving you more time to focus on your creativity and gameplay. Built entirely in **vanilla Scratch using only the Pen extension**, it proves that high-performance 3D is possible within the block-based world.

## ⚡ Quickstart Guide
Ready to start building? Follow these steps:

1.  **Download:** Get the `Glue3D 1.0.sb3` file from the [repository here](https://github.com/GL00B/GLUE3D/blob/main/Glue3D%201.0.sb3).
2.  **Import:** Open [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/), click on `File` > `Load from your computer`, and select the file.
3.  **Optimize:** While Glue3D is 100% vanilla compatible, **[TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org/) is highly recommended** for the best performance and higher frame rates.
4.  **Learn:** We strongly recommend reading the **[Official Documentation](https://gl00b.github.io/GLUE3D/)** to understand how to navigate the engine and start creating your first project.
